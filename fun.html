<div class="post"><h1>Kinds of Activities!</h1>
<p>Shaped by the folks living here at differents, the collective has had lots of different kinds of  fun and celebration together sometimes with all of us and sometimes with some of us.. We sometimes have done murder mystery parties, talent shows, poetry readings, pajama brunches, tarot and divination, gotten our hands dirty together in the garden, gone on hikes, gone to rallies, howled at the moon, done crosswords, karoke, singalongs, jam sessions, made puppets, visited the ocean, backyard fires, danced a maypole, made shared art, and other escapades. </p>
