<div class="post"><h1>about the collective principles</h1>
<p>The inital collective came up with these after living together for around a year, and worked to name the principles and values that had emerged. </p>

<div class="post"><h1>current ones</h1>
<p><li> Milkweed seeks to nourish those of us who live together & also our extended networks of connection. We invite cool events, skillshares, cooking parties, art making projects, and friends into our shared space.</li>
<li>Milkweed works to take care of one another. We make and share food with each other. We reach out and connect, and support each other’s boundaries. We make space for each other’s time, play, and limits. We all take care of our home.</li>
<li>Milkweed is process-oriented. We work to figure things out together and honour the process as it emerges and evolves. </li>
<li>Milkweed works to be a good guest, and to do as little harm as we can.</li>
<li>Milkweed plays. We invite joy, silliness, and laughter into our home. Sometimes this looks like strange noises, messy art, throwing things in the air, and playing games together. We live in a house where we can have fun!</li>
<li>Milkweed works to support each other in dismantling oppression in our relationships, both interpersonally & communally.</li>
<li>Milkweed tries, and we do our best as much as we can. </li>
