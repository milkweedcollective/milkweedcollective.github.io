<div class="post"><h1>about us</h1>
<p>The Milkweed Collective is a co-living, vegan, shared-housing and resources project, currently residing in a house called the Meadow in so-called East Vancouver. We formed in mid 2017, and have been living together in different ways ever since!</p>
<h2>05 Nov 2021</h2></div>

<div class="post"><h1>hello there</h1>
<p> The Milkweed collecitve is seeking new housemates for 2022! Multiple options are possible -  $675 for The Burrow( ), $500 for the Cat's Cradle(), or $1125 total to rent both! Every person also contributes $140-200 into the house fund, which pays for all utilites, bulk household supplies, annual farm produce membership, home improvement projects, and mutual aid contributions. </p>
<p> We have up to 2 rooms available for the right fit. We're excited about artists, introverts, extroverts, gardeners, vegans, and home tenders. Folks who are self-motivated, grounded in who they are, can step into the magic of co-creating a household, and enjoy both time alone and time with housemates tend to enjoy living here the most! To apply click here. For more information <a href="">on the space(s)</a> and our current household agreements, click here</p>
<p> Unforunately we are at capcity for cats and are unable to welcome dogs at this time, Other companions likely welcome.</p>
