<div class="post"><h1>hello there</h1>
<p> The Milkweed collecitve is seeking new housemates for 2022! Various options are available -  $675 for The Burrow(8 ¾” by 11 ½”), $525 for the Cat's Cradle(8 ½ “ by 10 ½”), or $1100 total to rent both! Every person also contributes $140-200(sliding scale) into the house fund, which pays for all utilites, bulk household supplies, pantry essentials, an annual farm produce membership, home improvement projects, and mutual aid contributions. </p>
<p> We have up to 2 rooms available for the right fit. We're excited about artists, introverts, extroverts, gardeners, vegans, and home tenders. Couples and families are welcome to apply. Folks who are self-motivated, grounded in who they are, can step into the magic of co-creating a household, and enjoy both time alone and time with housemates tend to enjoy living here the most! To apply <a href="https://form.typeform.com/to/epn9zPgR">click here.</a> For more information <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13u0a1dqWvNhSzQWON7wzlVhbhW7K2skNiSNRCPKsLCE/edit?usp=sharing">on the space(s)</a> click here. </p>
<p> Unforunately we are at capcity for cats and are unable to welcome dogs at this time, Other companions likely welcome!</p>
