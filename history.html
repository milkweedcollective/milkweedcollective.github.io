<div class="post"><h1>History and Systems</h1>
<p>We've experimented with various systems and strategies for living together and likely will try out more. What's worked has slowly come together from all the various folks who have lived and contributed their energy and perspective. We're also curious how other folks do things!</p>

<div class="post"><h1>Food and Joy</h1>
<p> Each week we all cook at least one meal for everyone! or if we're nervious about solo cooking we may support a couple of meals a week as a team. We stock some groceries communally out of our house fund - think bulk beans, a CSA membership, tubs of olive oil, but rely on the generosity of housemates for the little touches that really elevate a pantry and a meal. Everyone brings their own vibe, history, energy and experience to their dishes, and it's a lot of fun!</p>

<div class="post"><h1>Circles</h1>
<p>Circles are what we call our commitment to gathering and spending intentional time together around a specific topic or theme! Every month we have a 'house circle' where we eat brunch and check in about how we're feeling, do some show and tell, and shrare or reflect on our intentions for our home lives. we also have admin circle where interested folks discuss systems (like thes!) propose changes, talk budget, and otherwise hash out the specifics of the logistics. Anyone also can call a circle on a specific topic as needed to figure out a specific issue or theme. Other kinds of circles include: we circle to hang out and do an activity or craft once a month or so and we have 'digital circles' or channels for specific topics (pet circle! garden circle!).</p>

<div class="post"><h1>Cleaning and Gentle Lists of Positive Actions</h1>
<p>The house has a co-developed list of cleaning and other household tasks based on the knowledge and needs of folks living here. We periodically revise and update as folks, needs, and knolwedge change. The list, divided in weekly/daily/monthly, lives in the kitchen where folks can check off whenever they complete task and also indicate their plans to do a certain task. We alll agree to try do at least some tasks each week, while recogonizing everyone's capacity is different at different times. The checklist allows us to celebrate and notice those who are going above and beyond and helps motivate all of us to do our best.</p>

<h2>2022</h2></div>

<div class="post"><h1>Digital Technologies</h1>
<p>We've experimented with a variety of tools, and right now we are pretty happy with Slack, Splitwise, and Notion. We use Slack to stay in touch, share cute pictures and useful links, post about dinner, and talk about decisions, repairs and todos. We use Splitwise to manage rent payments, house found contributions, and reimbursements for collective members. Inside Notion we track our pantry inventory and also track the budget! </p>
